After you have worked your butt of to complete of a beautiful, but long project, what is one of the last things you want to foget about? Producing that sweet looking README file to showcase your code. README's are so important to the professionality of your code as this is the first thing anyone see. A sloppy README showcases sloppy code.

Our command-line Professional README Generator helps you show that your amazing README, is just a taste of how good your code looks. After taking you through some simple command-line prompts, our application quickly and easily creates that README that you have always wanted.

## [Project Status](#project-status)
    MVP - Minimal Viable Product

To get a look at the code used for this application, checkout our my <a href="https://github.com/werthird/Professional-README-Generator-Module-09">GitHub Repo!</a> 

<br />

*Click on this [**LINK**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pgNIsay2YsOpGeCvZEuselizqn6VNUgK/view?usp=sharing) to get a walk through video of how to use the application.*

<br />

## [Installation](#installation)
If you are wanting to use this application on your own system, you will need to know a few things:

1.  This is a command-line application. It uses the NPM Module [**Inquirer.js**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer?activeTab=readme). Please follow this link to read about it: 

2. Clone down this repo onto your local system.

3. After doing so, open a terminal in the Professional-README-Generator-Module-09 file, and enter the following code:
	```
	npm i
	```

<br />

## [Useage](#useage)
This is a command-line application that will take you through a series of prompt to build the README.

1. After the module is installed on your local system, you are ready to use this app. Enter this code into your terminal:
	```
	node index.js
	```

2. Follow the prompts in the command-line to populate your professional new README!
   
	 **Note:** to build the Description sections and the Usage section of the README, we provide you with a text editor, so you can build out more information. Sometimes this text editor doesn't pop-up right away. Look on your task bar to locate it. 
	 
	 When you are finished, press the close button and make sure to select SAVE! This won't save to your device, rather it will save it to the terminal so it can be added to the README.
